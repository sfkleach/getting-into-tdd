"""
This is a bonus problem that builds on resistance.py. We add a
new type of component - the switch. A switch is either open or
closed:

    <switch value="open" />
    <switch value="closed" />

No current can flow through an open switch and its resistance is
effectively infinite. A closed switch however has no resistance and
it is as if the resistance was zero. For example:

    <parallel>
        <switch value="open" />
        <series>
            <resistor value = "1" />
            <resistor value = "5" />
            <switch value="closed" />
        </series>
    </parallel>

In this example, the inner 'series' can ignore the closed switch and the
outer 'parallel' can ignore the open switch. So this boils down to
a resistor of 1 in series with one of 5 = overall 6.

Adding switches means explicitly copying with zero and infinity, so
you need to decide how to represent those values and make sure that
your series and parallel computations work properly with them.
