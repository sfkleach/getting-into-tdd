# Examples for the Getting Into Test-Driven Development workshop

## Background.

This workshop is something of a reaction to a work experience that I had a year ago. Too many unit-tests were being submitted that I felt were a bit 'aimless'. I spent a while thinking about how to get across the essence of a purposeful unit test - and somewhat belatedly, this workshop (and possibly others) has emerged.

I hope to share two things in this workshop. The first is the basic idea of using unit-tests to driving development *as opposed to testing an application*. These TDD tests are tightly focussed and come with a sense of hard purpose. They are the antidote to aimless unit tests.

The second aspect of TDD I would like attendees to pick up is the TDD workcycle. The significance of this to me is that we get a vocabulary for the moment-by-moment activities of development. Giving the different things we do names is a necessary first step for reflection on our practice and self-improvement. If recognise that you are in a *spike* it's much easier to take control of what happens with the output. If you know you have to *leap*, then you're going to realise you need *reinforcements*.

## The Problems.

There are a variety of problems to work on. These are presented in Python3 as that's seems to be the common tongue for [CodeHub](https://www.codehub.org.uk/). They have been picked to be easy-to-state and to have something interesting in their back-story. 

The idea of the problems is that they are just difficult enough that they need at least several scenarios to drive the development. Until I run the workshop I won't know whether they are too hard for the time available or not. However you will need to be comfortable programming with Python3 and have some kind of unit-testing environment available.
